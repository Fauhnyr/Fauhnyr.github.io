            <p> Hello, My name is David Pedraza and I work as a secondary teacher.<br> I always had a big passion for videogames and computers, but I never gave a thought about doing something about it until this year (2022 when I started writing this section.</p>
            <p> After focusing my life on watching others grow and make, I wanted to do something for MYSELF. Since I was a little boy and I saw how using command line (now I know that was what was happening) and disks you could install videogames in the early 90's computers, I always wanted to do something like that!! </p>
            <p> I decided to try coding, and it feels so good to make things, to see them growing and them mutating and starting to become something! I just do not want to stop! </p>
